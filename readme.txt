What is Ht2sp?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ht2Sp...
(1) reads a text file,
(2) replaces all horizontal tabs in this file by spaces, and 
(3) writes the converted text into a second file.

The thing that is special about Ht2Sp is that it does not substitute each tab by the same number of spaces. Instead it substitutes each tab by the number of spaces that is appropriate to preserve column alignment in the input text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is important!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ht2sp is freeware. 

So, strictly speaking, you should not expect this program to do anything else than to decrease the amount of free memory in your computer. Since you don't pay anything for this program, this is actually already a bit of feature overkill... ;-)

Anyway, I appreciate any suggestions how to improve Ht2sp. If you find that Ht2sp doesn't work as you think it should, send me a note. If possible, please attach an example for input text that causes the problem.

The most recent version of Ht2sp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will upload any future revisions of Ht2Sp to Hobbes (http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/ or ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/) only.

I have no particular preferences for Hobbes, except that it's one of the better known OS/2 software servers in that part of the world where I presently happen to live.
